History
The origin of Adana kebab goes back to the depths of the kebab tradition. Adana cuisine, which was shaped by the combination of immigrants and locals, especially in the 19th century, paved the way for the emergence of this unique version of kebab. Traditionally, minced meat is skewered and cooked over a wood fire.

Ingredients
One of the most distinctive features of Adana kebab is the quality of the ingredients used. For kebabs, which are usually made from lamb, the meat must contain at least 20% fat. This is a critical element that increases the flavor of the kebab. In addition, the following ingredients are also used:

Minced lamb
Red pepper
Onion
Cumin
Salt
Seasonings (optional)
Preparation
The way to make Adana kebab at home is quite enjoyable. Here is a simple recipe:

Finely chop the lamb meat and fat or grind it in a meat grinder.
Grate the onion and squeeze the water.
Knead all the ingredients (meat, onion, spices) in a bowl.
Thread the mixture you prepared onto skewers and shape them.
Cook on a preheated grill or barbecue.
Serving Suggestions
Adana kebab is usually served with lavash bread and various appetizers. You can achieve a beautiful presentation with sumac onions, green peppers and tomatoes on the side. In addition, drinks such as ayran or turnip juice complement the taste of the kebab.

Conclusion
Adana kebab is not only a food, but also a culture and tradition. In every bite, you feel the history and hospitality of Adana. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend you do!
